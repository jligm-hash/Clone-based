Short description
---
This is the short description of tests for **tugHall** _(**tu**mor **g**ene-**Hall**mark)_, which is cancer-cell evolution model simulator, wherein gene mutations are linked to the tumor cell behaviors, which are influenced by the hallmarks of cancer.
For detailed description, kindly see _User-Guide-Tests_v2.0.Rmd_.


Content of tests in the _User-Guide-Tests_v2.0.Rmd_:
---

* **tests of repeating simulations** to make sure that code generates data in accordance with the model (the tests for division, environmental and apoptosis deaths). 
* **tests for invasion/metastasis transformation and Heyflick limit** - there are tests for invasion/metastasis transformation and Heyflick limitation.
* **Hallmarks tests** - there are test to make sure that probabilities depend on hallmarks properly.
* **tests for mutations** - there tests to make sure that hallmarks depend on mutation properly.
