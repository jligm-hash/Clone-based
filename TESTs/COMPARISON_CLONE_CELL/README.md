Short description
---
This is the short description of comparison of simulations data for cell-based and clone-based codes of **tugHall** _(**tu**mor **g**ene-**Hall**mark)_, which is cancer-cell evolution model simulator, wherein gene mutations are linked to the tumor cell behaviors, which are influenced by the hallmarks of cancer.
For detailed description, kindly see _tugHall_v2.0_clone/tugHall_2_clones/Documentation/User-Guide_v_2.0.Rmd_.
